Description: Vyattanized DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment
 This is the server from version 3 of the Internet Software
 Consortium's implementation of DHCP. For more information, visit

 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like BOOTP
 (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of bootpd). It
 gives client machines "leases" for IP addresses and can
 automatically set their network configuration.

 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like BOOTP
 (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of bootpd). It
 gives client machines "leases" for IP addresses and can
 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.
